#More basic test benches from the Coursera forum.
# Matrices for testing the R functions
# makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve

# First,
# If you haven't read Leonard Greski's invaluable
# [TIPS] Demystifying makeVector()  Post
# be sure to do so.
#
# A simple matrix m1 with a simple matrix inverse n1
# Define
m1 <- matrix(c(1 / 2, -1 / 4, -1, 3 / 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m1

# m1
#[,1]  [,2]
#[1,]  0.50 -1.00
#[2,] -0.25  0.75

# You can use m1 to test your
# makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve functions.
# Since the grading is done on the correctness of your
# makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve functions and your
# comments on how they work, using this (or some other)
# test matrix to check your code
# before submitting it
# is OK relative to the Coursera Honor Code.
# (Checking code with test cases is always a good idea.)
#
# m1 was constructed (using very simple linear algebra, so
# no references are given, almost surely the examples
# in this post have been given many times before)
# to have a simple marrix inverse, call it n1.
# This means  m1 %*% n1 (%*% is matrix multiply in R)
# is the 2 row by 2 column Identity matrix I2
I2 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
I2
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    1    0
#[2,]    0    1

# And so (by linear algebra) n1 %*% m1 is also equal I2.
# (If n1 is the inverse of m1 then m1 is the inverse of n1.)
# With m1 defined as above, n1 ( the inverse of m1) is
n1 <- matrix(c(6, 2, 8, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
n1
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    6    8
#[2,]    2    4

# Checks:
m1 %*% n1
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    1    0
#[2,]    0    1

n1 %*% m1
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    1    0
#[2,]    0    1

solve(m1)
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    6    8
#[2,]    2    4

solve(n1)
#[,1]  [,2]
#[1,]  0.50 -1.00
#[2,] -0.25  0.75

# So if you have programmed your functions
# correctly (in the file cachematrix.R),
# (that, and your comments-explanation of how they work
# are what you are graded on)
# and sourced cachematrix.R so they are
# available in your R session workspace, then doing
#
myMatrix_object <- makeCacheMatrix(m1)

# and then
# cacheSolve(myMatrix_object)

# should return exactly the matrix n1
cacheSolve(myMatrix_object)
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    6    8
#[2,]    2    4

# calling cacheSolve again should retrieve (not recalculate)
# n1
cacheSolve(myMatrix_object)
#getting cached data
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    6    8
#[2,]    2    4

# you can use the set function to "put in" a new matrix.
# For example n2
n2 <- matrix(c(5 / 8, -1 / 8, -7 / 8, 3 / 8), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
myMatrix_object$setMatrix(n2)
# and obtain its matrix inverse by
cacheSolve(myMatrix_object)
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    3    7
#[2,]    1    5

cacheSolve(myMatrix_object)
#getting cached data
#[,1] [,2]
#[1,]    3    7
#[2,]    1    5
